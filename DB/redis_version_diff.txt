Top Redis Use Cases
Below are the top use cases of redis as follows. There are multiple use cases defined in redis as follows:

1 Session cache – This is the most important use case for redis. Redis is important when implementing an in-memory cache to reduce data latency. Redis serves requested items in milliseconds, allowing us to easily
 scale high loads without expanding the backend. A database query will cache used objects such as images and metadata files.
Queues, chat, and messaging – Redis will support the sub and pub by using pattern matching and data structures variety which are defined in sorted sets and lists. This allows the redis to support the feeds of s
ocial media, chat rooms, and comments of real streams. The lightweight queue will be created and implemented by the redis data structure. List will offer the atomic operations.
Gaming leaderboards – Redis is a very popular choice for developing game leaderboards. We need to use only data structures which provide unique elements while maintaining a list of sorted user scores. We can also
 use the sorted sets for handling the data of time series at the time of using in timestamps.
Session store – Redis stores data in the memory by using high availability, it is a very good choice for developers to manage and store the session data. Redis is responsible for user-specific personalization.
Rich media streaming – Redis provides fast data storage in memory. Redis also stores user metadata about user profiles and will view user information to enable streaming video on multiple desktops or mobiles at the same time.
Geospatial – Redis manages geospatial data in order to scale the speed. We use commands like GEODIST and GEOADD to store and process geospatial data in real-time. Using redis, we can also use the location-based feature.
Machine learning – In data-driven applications, machine learning is required. For the application of fraud detection, a real-time binding that is processing data is live and will make decisions.
Real-time analytics – Redis is used in streaming solutions such as Amazon Kinesis and Apache Kafka. It is a memory structure that stores data for ingesting processes with a specified latency.
Redis Use Cases for Developers
There are multiple use cases available for developers in redis. Below is the use case of redis for developers as follows:

Fast fraud detection for decisions in real-time – The cost of fraud is increasing. Opportunities will follow the growth that has been leading the way in the digital space by utilizing retailers, fraudsters, and gaming. 
Several companies are using ground-based biometrics to track down fraudsters. This is not a unique challenge; according to data, online transactions increased faster after Covid-19.
Modern experiences in gaming – The successful gaming application requires user experience which posted challenges in infrastructure specifically for real-time games of multi-player. The user is launching the game connects
 to the gaming server and collaborates with the players. Experience in gaming includes real-time transactions which involve money. In gaming applications, developers will rely on low latency and deliver the best performance
 and unlimited scales. As we all know, the Indian team releases their game rosters prior to the start of the match. This contains massive data but does not include the impact on customer experience, particularly in terms of time.
Ecommerce framework of omni channel – At the time of creating an online business digital presence, it will curve the massive experience. The modern multi-channel retailer is used real-time inventory for optimizing the
 inventory. The developers who were developing applications found it difficult to maintain and build these systems.
Real-time analytics with new revenue streams – In day-to-day life businesses requires software that instantly collects and stores large volumes of data. Many technologies support complex and large ingest for streaming 
real-time data from the application and the internet. Data is analyzed quickly using these applications in order to make quick business decisions. The best example of using redis is a data ingestion, which demonstrated high
 performance.
Painless business scalability – Using a new work as an example, which is used to build cloud-based suites for the software industry. While pursuing extraordinary growth, organizations will stain their capability in 
application architecture.
=============================================================================Redis 4.0.0-RC1 release=============================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC1 (version number 3.9.101) is the first release candidate of
Redis 4.0. It is not a production quality release but all the major features
received some testing at this point, the release in feature freeze excluding
things that are considered in the middle ground between fixes and improvements.

Redis 4.0 is not called 3.4 because it is a major release that adds a number
of important and non trivial features. Many core functionalities of Redis were
seriously reworked. In the next release candidates, with your help, we'll gain
informations about the stability level of this release and will produce a new
RC every 2-4 weeks. When the entity and frequency of bug reports will slow down
under a certain level, Redis 4.0 final will be released.

As usually, certain changes to Cluster and Sentinel may not follow the Redis
release cycle and could be incorporated into Redis 4.0 at RC stage or even
after the final version, every time the changes are considered to benefit
the user base enough to be worth incorporating them ASAP without waiting
for Redis 4.2.

So, what's new in Redis 4.0?

Major features
---

* Redis modules system. Redis now allows developers to write modules that can extend the Redis functionalities and implement new data types. The module API implements a complete abstraction layer
 that separates the Redis core from the module implementation, allowing the same module to be loaded by different versions of Redis without modifications. See the modules documentation here for 
 more info: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md

* Partial Replication (PSYNC) version 2. The replication protocol was enhanced (in a backward compatible way, so that 4.0 can still act as a slave of older instances) in order to be able to partially
 resynchronize slaves and masters in conditions where it was impossible in the past: after a master switch because of a failover and when a slave instance is restared. Even masters turned into slaves 
 will usually be able to partially resynchronize with the new master, if the new master was a former slave of the old master instance. The way the replication work for chained slaves (sub-slaves) is 
 now very different, and each slave receives the same replication stream generated by the top-level master.

* Cache eviction improvements. Redis 4.0 implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) as a new eviction algorithm, and improves the functionality, performances and precision of the existing algorithms. This 
blog post contains info about the changes: http://antirez.com/news/109

* Lazy freeing of keys. Redis is now able to delete keys in the background in a different thread without blocking the server. The new `UNLINK` command is the same as `DEL` but working in a non blocking
 way. Similarly an `ASYNC` option was added to `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` in order to let the entire dataset or a single database to be freed asynchronously.

* Mixed RDB-AOF format. If enabled the new format is used when rewriting the AOF file: the rewrite uses the more compact and faster to generate RDB format, and an AOF stream is appended to the file. This
 allows faster rewrites and reloads when using the AOF persistence.

* A new MEMORY command, able to perform memory analysis of different kinds: troubleshooting of memory issues (with MEMORY DOCTOR, similar to LATENCY DOCTOR), reporting of the amount of memory used by a 
single key, more in-depth reporting of Redis memory usage compared to what the INFO command offers.

* Redis Cluster support for NAT / Docker. There are new functionalities in order to force cluster instances to announce specific sets of IP address, client and bus ports, to the rest of the cluster, regardless
 of the auto detected IP. This required a bus protocol change that will force users to mass-restart all the nodes of a Redis 3.2 installation in order to upgrade to 4.0.

* Redis uses now less memory in order to store the same amount of data. The gain depends a lot on the kind of dataset stored.

* Redis is now able to defragment the used memory and reclaim space incrementally
while running. See the example `redis.conf` for more information.

Smaller features
---

* Improvements to the RDB format to support 64 bit lengths, binary sorted set scores, and more. The RDB file check utility now uses the same code base of the one used by Redis itself in order to load the RDB file in memory.

* SWAPDB command: ability to completely and immediately (no latency) replace two Redis databases.

* Improvements to `dict.c`, the Redis hash table implementation.

* Security improvements mapping POST and Host: commands to QUIT in order to prevent cross protocol scripting attacks.

* RPUSHX and LPUSHX now accept a variable number of elements.

* Reporting of additional memory used by copy on write in the INFO output.

* Serious refactoring of many core parts of Redis.

Migrating from 3.2 to 4.0
=========================

Redis 3.2 is mostly a strict subset of 4.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.2 to 4.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 4.0 release:

* The Redis Cluster bus protocol of 4.0 is no longer compatible with Redis 3.2.
  This was needed in order to provide Docker / NAT compatibility to Redis
  Cluster. SO in order to upgrade a Redis Cluster to 4.0, a mass restart of
  all the instances is needed.

* Redis Cluster CLUSTER NODES output is now slightly different. Nodes
  addresses are now in the form host:port@bus-port instead of host:port.
  Clients should use CLUSTER SLOTS in order to fetch the cluster configuration
  however if they are still using CLUSTER NODES, they should be modified in
  order to ignore the @bus-port part.

* Writable slaves do not propagate writes to their sub-slaves, so writes to
  writable slaves remain just local.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 4.0 is still able to read 3.2 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 4.0.

* Certain INFO fields, especially related to replication, are now different.

* GEODIST, GEOPOS and GEOHASH return values changed for non existing keys:
  Previously the return value was inconsistent between non existing key
  and non existing elements. Now the return is always like if the key
  contains no elements if the key does not exist. So, for instance,
  "GEOHASH non_existing_key A B C" now returns an array of 3 NULL values
  as it should. In general this change should not break compatibility with
  the past since in the past two different forms were provided by the server
  and the new behavior is one of the two.

* The SLOWLOG command entires contain additional two fields: the client address
  and name. This is documented in the SLOWLOG command online documentation.
=============================================================================Redis 5 release=============================================================================
Redis 5 is a release focused on a few important features. While Redis 4
was very very focused on operations, Redis 5 changes are mostly user-facing,
with the implementation of new data types and operations on top of existing
types. The following are the major features of this release:

1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
   inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
    - Better propagation of Lua scripts to slaves / AOF.
    - Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the slave as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.
Migrating from 4.0 to 5.0
=========================

Redis 4.0 is mostly a strict subset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 4.0 to 5.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 5.0 release:

* redis-cli now implements the cluster management tool. We still ship the
  old redis-trib, but new fixes will be implemented only in redis-cli.
  See `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 5.0 is still able to read 4.0 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 5.0.

* Now by default maxmemory is ignored by slaves, and used only once a slave
  is promoted to master. It means that in setups where you want slaves to
  enforce maxmemory in an independent way from the master (that will anyway
  stream the key eviction DEL commands), you should active this feature manually
  and make sure you understand that it breaks consistency if writes are not
  always idempotent. TLDR: the new behavior is much better for 99.999% of use
  cases, revert it if you really know what you are doing.

* Scripts are only replicated by their *effects* and not by sending EVAL/EVALSHA
  to slaves or the AOF log itself. This is much better in the general case
  and in the future we want to totally remove the other possiblity of
  propagating scripts the old way (as EVAL). However you can still turn this
  back to the default via the non-documented (if not here) Redis configuration
  directive "lua-replicate-commands yes" or
  "DEBUG lua-always-replicate-commands 0". However note that Redis 6 may
  completely remove such feature.

* Because of the above change related to scripts replication, certain Redis
  commands that in Redis 4 had their result ordered lexicographically before
  being passed to Lua via the return value of redis.call(), now have a behavior
  more similar to calling the commands directly from a normal client. For
  instance the ordering of elements returned by SMEMBERS or SDIFF is now
  undetermined in Lua, exactly as it is by default when calling the commands
  from a non-scripting context.
  
=============================================================================Redis 6 release=============================================================================

Redis 6 improves Redis in a number of key areas and is one of the largest
Redis releases in the history of the project, so here we'll list only
the biggest features in this release:

* The modules system now has a number of new APIs that allow module authors
  to make things otherwise not possible in the past. It is possible to
  store arbitrary module private data in RDB files, to hook on different
  server events, capture and rewrite commands executions, block clients on
  keys, and so forth. 
* The Redis active expire cycle was rewritten for much faster eviction of keys
  that are already expired. Now the effort is tunable.
* Redis now supports SSL on all channels.
* ACL support, you can define users that can run only certain commands and/or
  can only access only certain keys patterns.
* Redis now supports a new protocol called RESP3, which returns more
  semantical replies: new clients using this protocol can understand just
  from the reply what type to return to the calling program.
* There is server-side support for client-side caching of key values. This
  feature is still experimental and will get more changes during the next
  release candidates, but you can already test it and read about it here:
  https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
* Redis can now optionally use threads to handle I/O, allowing to serve
  2 times as much operations per second in a single instance when
  pipelining cannot be used.
* Diskless replication is now supported even on replicas: a replica is now
  able, under certain conditions the user can configure, to load the RDB
  in the first synchronization directly from the socket to the memory.
* Redis-benchmark now supports a Redis Cluster mode.
* SRANDMEMBER and similar commands have a better distribution.
* Redis-cli improvements.
* Systemd support rewritten.
* A Redis Cluster proxy was released here:
  https://github.com/artix75/redis-cluster-proxy
* A Disque module for Redis was released here:
  https://github.com/antirez/disque-module
  
Migrating from 5.0 to 6.0
=========================

Redis 6.0 is mostly a strict superset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 5.0 to 6.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 6.0 release:

* The SPOP <count> command no longer returns null when the set key does not
  exist. Now it returns the empty set as it should and as happens when it is
  called with a 0 argument. This is technically a fix, however it changes the
  old behavior.  
  
=============================================================================Redis 7.0 GA=============================================================================
Redis 7.0 includes several new user-facing features, significant performance
optimizations, and many other improvements. It also includes changes that
potentially break backwards compatibility with older versions. We urge users to
review the release notes carefully before upgrading.

In particular, users should be aware of the following changes:

1. Redis 7 stores AOF as multiple files in a folder; see Multi-Part AOF below.
2. Redis 7 uses a new version 10 format for RDB files, which is incompatible
   with older versions.
3. Redis 7 converts ziplist encoded keys to listpacks on the fly when loading
   an older RDB format. Conversion applies to loading a file from disk or
   replicating from a Redis master and will slightly increase loading time.
4. See sections about breaking changes mentioned below.

Here is a comprehensive list of changes in this release compared to 6.2.6.
Each one includes the PR number that added it so that you can get more details
