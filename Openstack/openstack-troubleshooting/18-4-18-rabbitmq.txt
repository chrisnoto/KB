Hi  石瑞，
 
之前都没看邮件。
从log里看到这行。
=INFO REPORT==== 17-Apr-2018::17:56:51 ===
Limiting to approx 924 file handles (829 sockets)
 
猜测是你们server上file descriptors用完了。 log里很多emfile error.
对比下我自己openstack环境里的设置
=INFO REPORT==== 4-Nov-2017::12:55:44 ===
Limiting to approx 99900 file handles (89908 sockets)

请查看下你们的ulimit设置。

下面是rabbitmq对并发连接数的调优。
When optimising for the number of concurrent connections, making sure your system has enough file descriptors
 to support not only client connections but also files the node may use.
 To calculate a ballpark limit, multiply the number of connections per node by 1.5. For example, to support 100,000 connections, 
set the limit to 150,000. Increasing the limit slightly increases the amount of RAM idle machine uses 
but this is a reasonable trade-off.
