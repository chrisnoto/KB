#### reset password for CentOS7 on openstack ###

1  going to the GRUB menu
select the kernel and press e to edit the kernel command-line arguments
The documentation tells us we should add rd.break enforcing=0 to the kernel command line (the one starting with linux16…). 
However, cloud images redirect console to ttyS0, which is the serial console, and not the graphical console we have in the OpenStack dashboard. 
So remove the console=ttyS0… parameters (there are two in this example), and make sure we have console=tty0 in the command line.
When finished, press Ctrl-x to boot. You’ll see the kernel boot messages, and get a root prompt.

2 chroot and reset password
The root file system is mounted read-only under /sysroot, but you can remount it read-write and then chroot to it.
# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
# chroot /sysroot
# passwd

3 exit chroot and reboot
# mount -o remount,ro /
# exit
# reboot
