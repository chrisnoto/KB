Two questions:
1. For sync, is there a possibility, to sync any main OU and all other sub-OU's (e.g. OU=ISE which contains OUs Guest, Student, Employee, which has uids)?
So I must create for every OU an additional Windows Sync Agreement.

As to your first question, the OUs will sync if you have created them ahead of time. This is why I have included the section on dumping your AD schema 
and loading it into the Directory Server. Once the schema is in place the OU will sync normally.


Dumping and Import Active Directory OU's

Some people, particularly businesses will have more than just the default OU's. If this is the case you will need to dump your OU's from Active Directory into 
an ldif file in order to be imported into the 389 server. If this is the case for you, here are some handy commands to run on the AD server

Code:
ldifde -f example_groups.ldif -d "dc=example,dc=com " -p subtree -r "(&(objectCategory=group)(objectClass=group))" -l "cn,objectclass"

ldifde -f example_users.ldif -d "dc=example,dc=com"  -p subtree -r "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=User)(givenname=*))" -l "cn,givenName,objectclass,samAccountName"

ldifde -f example_ous.ldif -d "dc=example,dc=com" -p subtree -r "(objectCategory=organizationalUnit)" -l "cn,objectclass,ou"
The most important one is the last one dumping to example_ous.ldif. The others are optional depending on whether or not you wish to allow the 389 server to pull those down 
from AD or whether you want to do most of the work at once.

After you have this(these) file(s) you can now import then in the 389 server
