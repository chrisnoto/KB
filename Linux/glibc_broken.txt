#### 问题描述
Starting Switch Root: While starting the server it will not move forward after “Starting Switch Root” as shown below. 
The reason behind this could be a corrupted glibc package or totally it’s not available in the server.

Recently we have faced this issue in one of the Kubernetes production server running on CentOS 7.7. In this guide, we are going to use a CentOS 7.7 operating system.
 Additionally, the following guide will help to fix the glibc error as well. Interrupting ongoing patching which includes Glibc will also corrupt the Glibc.

####解决
模拟情景，先输出glibc然后reboot机器
之后通过光盘进入 linux rescue
Once we reach the rescue environment, continue by typing 1. Now it will print in screen to run chroot. 
But we need to ignore it, without doing a chroot we are going to fix this issue.
If you try to do a chroot it will throw an error as “No such file or directory“
sh-4.2# chroot /mnt/sysimage
chroot: failed to run command '/bin/bash': No such file or directory“
sh-4.2#

As we have boot this server from DVD or ISO and without doing chroot all the package in DVD/ISO can be found
 under /run/install/repo/Packages.
Reinstall Glibc package
Let’s start to reinstall the glibc package from the DVD/ISO using rpm command. Before installing the package we need to 
make sure what the command will do. Use --test to do a dry run without installing the package. 
# rpm -ivh --root=/mnt/sysimage  --test --replacefiles --replacepkgs /run/install/repo/Packages/glibc-2.17-292.el7.x86_64.rpm

Once we are confident about what we are doing, just remove the –test and run the same command to reinstall the glibc.
# rpm -ivh --root=/mnt/sysimage --replacefiles --replacepkgs /run/install/repo/Packages/glibc-2.17-292.el7.x86_64.rpm

Type exit to reboot the machine. Once you are back online you will be good.

To confirm the package installation you can find from /var/log/yum.log as well.

[root@web04 ~]# tail -n 2 /var/log/yum.log
 Mar 28 01:50:15 Updated: tzdata-2019c-1.el7.noarch
 Mar 31 17:58:11 Installed: glibc-2.17-292.el7.x86_64
[root@web04 ~]#
That’s it, we have successfully recovered from Starting Switch Root.
